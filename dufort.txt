Dufort–Frankel Scheme – Theory Notes
------------------------------------------------

Purpose:
The Dufort–Frankel scheme is an explicit numerical method used to solve parabolic PDEs like the heat (diffusion) equation.

Example PDE:
    ∂u/∂t = α ∂²u/∂x²

Key Features:
- Explicit method
- Unconditionally stable (more stable than FTCS)
- Second-order accuracy in time

Discretization:
Let u_i^n ≈ u(x_i, t^n), r = α Δt / (Δx)^2

Uses three time levels: u_i^{n+1}, u_i^n, and u_i^{n-1}

Update formula:
    u_i^{n+1} = [(1 - 2r) * u_i^{n-1} + 2r * (u_{i-1}^n + u_{i+1}^n)] / (1 + 2r)

Requires:
- Initial values u_i^0 (from the initial condition)
- First step (n = 1) computed separately using FTCS

Stability:
- More stable than FTCS
- Can use larger time steps without instability

Advantages:
- More efficient than Crank–Nicolson for explicit implementations
- Good for diffusion-type problems

Limitations:
- More complex than FTCS
- Needs two initial time levels

Exact Solution for Testing:
    For u(x, 0) = sin(πx), the exact solution at time t is:
    u(x, t) = exp(-π²αt) * sin(πx)
