MacCormack Scheme – Theory Notes
--------------------------------------------

Purpose:
The MacCormack scheme is a two-step predictor-corrector method used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations, such as the linear advection equation.

Example PDE:
    ∂u/∂t + a ∂u/∂x = 0,      where a > 0

Key Features:
- Explicit method
- Second-order accuracy in both time and space
- Suitable for wave and transport equations

Discretization:
Let u_i^n ≈ u(x_i, t^n), Δx = space step, Δt = time step

Predictor step (Forward difference in space):
    u_i* = u_i^n - (a Δt / Δx) * (u_{i+1}^n - u_i^n)

Corrector step (Backward difference in space):
    u_i^{n+1} = 0.5 * [u_i^n + u_i* - (a Δt / Δx) * (u_i* - u_{i-1}*)]

Stability Condition:
The CFL condition must be satisfied:
    a * Δt / Δx ≤ 1

Advantages:
- Higher accuracy than simple upwind schemes
- Simple and efficient for advection-dominated problems

Limitations:
- Conditional stability
- Not suitable for diffusion-dominated problems

Exact Solution for Testing:
    For initial condition u(x, 0) = sin(2πx), the exact solution at time t is:
    u(x, t) = sin(2π(x - at))
